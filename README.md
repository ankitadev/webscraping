# webscraping
scraping the web using Selenium, Beautifulsoup and requests in python

## Required packages and drivers
### Selenium
The [selenium package](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) is used to automate web browser interaction from Python.

    'pip install -U selenium'
    
             or
             
    ```pip install -r setup.py```
    
    i.e touch setup.py with 'selenium' in it

### ChromeDriver
    I have included ChromeDriver in the 'include' folder,
    but if you want to create your own project download ChromeDriver and include your path in your code

### Virtualenv
    `[sudo] pip install virtualenv`
